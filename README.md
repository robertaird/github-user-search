## GitHub User Search

A small app for searching GitHub users. Built with React's experimental concurrent API, using Relay to interact with GitHub's GraphQL API.

The server requires a `GITHUB_TOKEN` env variable.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
